* Who are the founders of the company?
Duolingo was co-founded by Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker. 
Luis von Ahn is a computer scientist and entrepreneur known for his work in developing innovative technologies, including CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA. 
Severin Hacker is a Swiss computer scientist who worked with von Ahn to develop Duolingo's language learning platform.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for Duolingo originated from the desire to create a platform that could simultaneously address two major challenges: making language learning accessible to a global audience and harnessing the power of crowdsourcing to solve real-world problems.

Luis von Ahn, one of the co-founders of Duolingo, had previously worked on projects like CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, which utilized human input to solve problems in artificial intelligence. Building on this concept, von Ahn sought to develop a platform that could leverage users' time spent learning languages to help translate text on the internet.

At the same time, von Ahn recognized the widespread demand for language learning resources and the barriers to access faced by many people around the world due to factors like cost and availability. He saw an opportunity to address this need by creating a free, user-friendly language learning platform that could reach a global audience.

By combining these two objectives—providing free language education and harnessing the collective effort of users to translate content—Duolingo was born. The platform offers a range of language courses taught in an interactive and gamified format, allowing users to learn new languages while also contributing to the translation of texts across the web. This innovative approach has made Duolingo one of the most popular language learning platforms worldwide.

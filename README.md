# TITLE - Doulingo: How I learned to speak Dutch!

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Doulingo
Duolingo uses AI to personalize language learning experiences for users. The platform adapts lessons based on learners' proficiency levels, strengths, and weaknesses via games where you select the appropiate translations, practice pronounciation and work to identify masculine/feminine pronouns (if it applies). It builds upon each lesson by starting with basic words and propositions, then stringing them into sentences. 

* When was the company incorporated?
Founded in 2011

* Who are the founders of the company?
Duolingo was co-founded by Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker. 
Luis von Ahn is a computer scientist and entrepreneur. Severin Hacker is a Swiss computer scientist, together they developed Duolingo's language learning platform.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for Duolingo started from the founders wanting to make language learning accessible & using crowdsourcing. I think this is super helpful as learning new languages prior to 2011 was expensive, both by having to purchase sophisticated CD's or other software solutions, or the traditional way, which is to go to a class. Neither of those solutions would receive feedback from native learners. As a bilingua person I often found issues with translations & courses as they focused on teaching formal language, not the way most people speak on a day to day basis. I appreciate that they focused on creating a free, user-friendly language learning platform that could reach all of us. I actually heard of Doulingo from a friend who lived in France.
The platform offers a range of language courses taught in an interactive or gaming format, allowing users to learn new languages while also contributing to the translation of texts across the web. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Duolingo's first investment was a $3.3 million Series A round led by Union Square Ventures and actor Ashton Kutcher's firm A-Grade Investments in October 2011. This initial investment helped to kickstart the growth of the company and further develop its language learning platform.
As of my last update in January 2022, Duolingo had gone public with an initial public offering (IPO) in July 2021. At the time of its IPO, Duolingo was valued at around $6.5 billion. So I would say that Ashton made quite a bit of money! Especially since it is now valued at $7.44 Billion

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Their goal is to provide free language education to anyone, anywhere by making language learning accessible, effective, and enjoyable for people around the world, regardless of their socioeconomic background or geographic location. From their website, they state that: "Through its platform, Duolingo offers a wide range of language courses designed to accommodate various skill levels and learning styles. Additionally, Duolingo's mission extends to promoting cultural understanding and communication by enabling users to learn new languages and connect with others from different linguistic backgrounds. Overall, Duolingo seeks to empower individuals to unlock opportunities and enrich their lives through language learning."

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Since they offer a gamified learning experience - their target audience is anyone from casual learners or language enthusiasts, as well as more serious learners like immigrants & professionals looking to enhance their job opportunities. I personally fall in the first category, I had a planned trip to the Netherlands and wanted to be able to communicate in Dutch, over 20 years ago I traveled abroad and found that locals were generally nicer if you tried to speak their language, at least for greetings, and some of my coworkers at the time said they appreciated my effort, even though may have unfortunately butchered the pronunciation. Doulingo was not avaialble in the early 2000's, and solutions were limited which is why I feel most people make an effort to understand and appreciate other cultures through their language when traveling, and through their food & memories when they are back home. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Their competitive advantage is not only the ease of use, but in my opinion, it is the cost. Doulingo Basic is free whereas their closest competitor - Rosetta Stone, has a cost of $12 to $15 a month (when you pay upfront), and the price varies depending on languages with some being more expensive than others. Babbel also works via subscription, while they are a bit more affordable at $7 to $14 a month, it does not beat Doulingo, which as I mentioned is free. Personally, I also think that Rosetta Stone & Babbel are percieved as more "serious" which may turn away casual learners, as well as younger audiences that appreciate the game aspect of Doulingo versus the "stuffiness" of signing up for a course with Rosetta Stone or Babbel.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
While I could not find direct confirmation on the Doulingo Engineering Blog site, other sites speculate that the backend service of the web-based version of Duolingo uses Python, which we are learning now in our course. I have the app in a Samsung Device and the likely programming language for the Android application is listed as Java or Kotlin, neither of which I am familiar with. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
While they focus on learning, Doulingo is recognized as a technology company, which I found interesting because I experienced the gamification of learning in the early 2000's at a job I had in automotive where we moved from formal presentations, to games to reinforce learning. It definitely kept people from falling asleep during training!

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
My opinion is that the primary change I've experienced in technology learning companies is the use of platform to give free (other than having a computer with internet access) content to learners across the world. The company that I feel led the way in this was Khan academy - which started when a developer wanted to teach his cousins remotely in math by doing videos for them. They found them helpful and the kids shared them across their school, they then got organized on a basic website and other users translated the videos to other languages. The innovative aspect of it is that it was not until Khan needed major server investment the majority of the content was created, translated and made available for free by the users. They croudsourced it and were not focused on profit the way other learning technologies had in the past. Do you remember how much the CD's of Encyclopdia Brittanica were in the 90's? or the Algebra Courses in CD's? They were quite pricy, thus, the innovation was on the reliance of users to croudsource content and make it available for free or a minimal cost, thus democratizing learning. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
The main companies I am familiar with in this field - which are also the biggest are (1) Khan Academy, which I described above, (2) Coursera, which makes college courses available online from universities worldwide in multiple languages. I have personally taken a couple dozen courses and certifications with them and use it as a primary development tool for people I coach at work. Finally edX is the third, which is relevant because the AI course I am taking - that this assignment is part of - is from this MOOC or massive open online course provider. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The primary impact is access to education to people worldwide, it reduces many barriers and while some people may not have reliable internet and/or a phone that can use the app, the fact that companies like Doulingo make their platform free gives many more people the opportunity to develop their skills. It is important to reduce the gaps to learning, and in the past that has been money as only those with the ability to drop hundreds - or thousands - of dollars on a tutor, classes or materials had access to learn. Gamification of learning also makes lifelong learners out of all of us, and keeps us engaged while developing skills that will be beneficial. Finally giving people the ability to collaborate accross the world - with reliance on user metrics - also helps future language translator software get smarter in the future. For example, one of the main features of Doulingo is listening to, and correcting your pronunciation. Doulingo can now use our various accents to improve translation software and even improve solutions like Google Voice and Siri, which have struggled understanding people with different accents in the past.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Approximately 500 million people are considered active in Doulingo in 2022 when they last reported. That is the equivalent of 57 New York Cities worth of people! However, Doulingo does not publicly release results on usage, courses completed, scores or other personal metrics for their users. However, I am sure they track it to continue developing their tools. I would be interested in them releasing Retention Rates - like how many people give up on the tool after certain amounts of time, as well as User Engagement, or how often people use the tool per day since it is harder and more objective to self-report proficiency unless you gave users a test that you are sure they did not "cheat" on to get a good score. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
While Doulingo is not THE largest, it is the most popular - at least from what they shared as an update in 2022. They are however recognized as being one of the most user-friendly, with some of the largest language libraries available. They are also one of the only ones that is free! 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would primarily advertise it as a "before you travel" tool. The same way we research customs, visa requirements, reccomended vaccinations & exciting locations to visit, it is just as important to learn the basics when it comes to being able to communicate with locals. I would encourage them to have a 30-day-crash-course feature where you learn basic greetings, asking for directions, managing in an emergency or seeking assistance, reccomendations and ordering basic food items in the local language. Many people who are world travelers would take that as a fun challenge as they prepare for their journeys. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Social Media is now doing an awesome job of showing us destinations that we would've never considered, and post pandemic many people are excited abot travel. According to the UN World Tourism Organization, over 1.46 Billion people traveled to international locations. If that number has increased by even 4%, which is the previous increase, that is approximately 59 million new travelers that would likely be open to a language crash course as most of us now seek immersive experiences in different cultures and it is socially frowned upon to automatically assume everyone will speak English (although many do in tourist locations). How lovely it would be to greet your host contry in their native tounge while exploring!

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It would require them to list off common tourist phrases, language and words and use their algorithm that builds upon each lesson, to organize them into common interactions you may have during your travels. i.e. (1)ordering at a restaurant & communicating allergies. (2) Asking for directions and transportation. (3) Seeking help and managing emergencies, etc. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The platform, learning experience & translated words are readily avaialble. They just need to be organized into specific travel-specific requirements. For example, the first set of words I learned in Dutch was names of fruits, which is great, but how great it woul've been if they would've added words like "allergy" or "I really like..." to the lesson, so I could express if I am allergic to a specific fruit early on in my learning. I did eventually learned to say "Ik vind bier echt lekker" - which won me plenty of smiles and conversations when ordering beer. :)
